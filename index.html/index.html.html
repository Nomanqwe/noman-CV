<P><h2>Origami Crane made by Sadako Sasaki on Display at the Battleship Missouri Memorial</h2></p>
  <p><h2><i><u>Introduction</u></p></h2></i>
  <P><h2><FONT FACE=“ARIAL” COLOR="voilet" SIZE=“+6” class="Introduction"> Sadako Sasaki was two years old on August 6th, 1945 when pilot Paul Tibbett of the United States Air Force flew his B-29 bomber airplane over the city of Hiroshima, Japan. Unlike the many other B-29 bombers that had flown over Hiroshima the past days and weeks, Tibbett’s bomber, the Enola Gay, was much different than previous B-29 bombers. The Enola Gay carried an atomic bomb named, “Little Boy.” By order of President Harry S. Truman, Tibbett and his crew dropped one of the most powerful bombs ever created over the city of Hiroshima, Japan and a population of approximately 350,000 people. The story of Sadako Sasaki, a young girl who lived through the bombing of Hiroshima, and eventually died from leukemia.</h2></font></p>
<h2><i><u>Body</h2></i></u>
<p><h2><FONT FACE=“ARIAL” COLOR="blue" SIZE=“+6” class="body">Sadako Sasaki was at home when the explosion occurred, about 1.6 kilometres (1 mi) away from ground zero. She was blown out of the window and her mother ran out to find her, suspecting she may be dead, but instead finding her two-year-old daughter alive with no apparent injuries. While they were fleeing, Sasaki and her mother were caught in black rain. Her grandmother rushed back to the house and was never seen again; later, she was presumed to be dead Sadako grew up like her peers and became an important member of her class relay team. In November 1954, Sasaki developed swellings on her neck and behind her ears. In January 1955, purpura had formed on her legs. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with acute malignant lymph gland leukemia (her mother and others in Hiroshima referred to it as "atomic bomb disease"). She was hospitalized on February 21st, 1955, and given no more than a year to live.

Several years after the atomic explosion an increase in leukemia was observed, especially among children. By the early 1950s, it was clear that the leukemia was caused by radiation exposure.

She was admitted as a patient to the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital for treatment and given blood transfusions on February 21, 1955. By the time she was admitted, her white blood cell count was six times higher than the average child's levels..</h2></font></p>
<p><h2><i><u>Conclusion</u></p></h2></i>
<p><h2><FONT FACE=“ARIAL” COLOR="blue" SIZE=“+6” class="conclution">In August 1955, Sasaki's friend, Chizuko Hamamoto, told her the legend of the cranes and she set herself a goal of folding 1,000 of them, which was believed to grant the folder a wish. She folded only 644 before her death and that her friends completed the 1,000 and buried them all with her.During her time in the hospital, her condition progressively worsened. Around mid-October 1955, her left leg became swollen and turned purple. After her family urged her to eat something, Sasaki requested tea on rice and remarked "It's tasty". She then thanked her family, those being her last words. With her family and friends around her, Sasaki died on the morning of October 25, 1955, at the age of 12.
